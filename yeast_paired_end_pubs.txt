generated âˆ_39 million 76bp strand-specific single-end reads per sample;Fragment counts within specified windows (e.g.,Â Â± 100Â bp) around the 564 Rap1 sites (1128 intervals total, Watson and Crick strand alignments were assigned to separate intervals) were obtained using the featureCounts tool from the Subread package (version 1.5.1) (Liao etÂ al., 2014);The parameters used were â€œ-Oâ€“minOverlap 1â€“nonSplitOnlyâ€“primary -s 2 -p -B -P -d 0 -D 600 -C.â€ù Windows on separate strands were treated as separate intervals for all strand-specific RNA-seq experiments, and only

1.3.1) by using the flags â€œ-q 1 -F 20â€ù and â€œ-q 1 -f 16,â€ù respectively (Li etÂ al., 2009);To calculate TPM values for each TSS, TSS-seq counts were obtained by quantifying the abundance of reads with the 1st transcribed 5â€_ nucleotide withinÂ Â± 75Â bp of annotated TSSs (Park etÂ al., 2014), on the respective strand"	"Specifically, Rap1 prevents transcription initiation at cryptic promoters near its binding sites, which is uncoupled from transcription regulation in the protein-coding direction;We propose that a sequence-specific transcription factor limits access of basal transcription machinery to regulatory elements and adjacent sequences that act as divergent cryptic promoters, thereby providing directionality toward productive transcription.;The transcriptionally active coding gene promoters, which often express noncoding transcripts in the antisense direction (Neil etÂ al., 2009, Seila etÂ al., 2008, Xu etÂ al., 2009), are a major source;This process is known as divergent or bidirectional transcription;A large fraction of all noncoding transcripts emanate from divergent or bidirectional gene promoters (Neil etÂ al., 2009, Seila etÂ al., 2008, Xu etÂ al., 2009);Typically, divergent noncoding transcripts initiate within or nearby coding gene promoters, but they do not share the same core promoter as transcripts in the coding direction (Andersson etÂ al., 2015, Duttke etÂ al., 2015, Rhee and Pugh, 2012, Scruggs etÂ al., 2015);We find that depletion of Rap1, but not other transcription factors important for RP expression, causes transcription in the divergent direction;Rap1 represses noncoding transcription typically within 50Â bp of the Rap1 motif, which is uncoupled from transcription regulation in the protein-coding direction;Thus, a sequence-specific transcription factor controls promoter directionality by repressing transcription in the divergent direction;Our work adds a new layer of regulation to various mechanisms that limit expression of aberrant transcripts and defines how promoter directionality is controlled.;In budding yeast, a large fraction of bidirectional promoters express noncoding transcripts, also known as cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) or stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs), in the divergent direction (Neil etÂ al., 2009, Xu etÂ al., 2009);Transcription of divergent CUTs and SUTs typically correlates with nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and promoter activity in the coding gene direction;Expression near the Rap1 binding sites was upregulated in both the sense and antisense direction after Rap1 depletion; however, the largest increase was detected in the antisense direction (FigureÂ 2E);When we clustered for the sense direction signals, we observed that transcripts were upregulated both up- and downstream of the Rap1 site (Sc1 and Sc2);Thus, Rap1 represses transcription near the Rap1 binding sites in the antisense, and to lesser extent, the sense direction.;We integrated Rap1 motifs in a fluorescent reporter construct that harbors a divergent promoter transcribing PPT1 in the coding direction and SUT129 in the noncoding direction (pPS) (Figures 3D and S3A) (Marquardt etÂ al., 2014);The repression of SUT129 by Rap1 was not dependent on transcription regulation in the coding direction because in RAP1-AID (IAA or NT) cells the PPT1 signal matched WT (FigureÂ 3E, right panel);As expected, TSS signals decreased in the sense direction downstream of the Rap1 binding sites in Rap1-depleted cells because coding gene expression was reduced (FigureÂ 4B, sense);Interestingly, sequences directly upstream of the canonical coding transcript TSSs displayed increased TSS signals in the sense direction, suggesting that Rap1 is also important for TSS selection (Challal etÂ al., 2018);Rap1 promotes transcription from the coding direction TSS (black arrows) but represses initiation from the divergent TSS;When Rap1 is absent, transcription in the divergent direction occurs.;Our data demonstrate how a sequence-specific transcription factor can prevent regulatory sequences from producing aberrant transcripts and define a mechanism for providing directionality toward productive transcription.;Several lines of evidence indicate that Rap1 represses divergent noncoding transcription, uncoupled from transcription regulation in the coding direction;Fourth, the Rap1 binding site ectopically represses divergent noncoding transcription without affecting transcription in the protein-coding direction;Conversely, the AD of Rap1, which directs transcription in the protein-coding direction, is not required for repressing divergent transcription;Promoter directionality is shaped by evolution toward protein-coding genes through enrichment of DNA binding protein motifs (Jin etÂ al., 2017);In this context, Rap1 promotes directionality in multiple ways;First, Rap1 recruits cofactors and basal transcription machinery, which promote transcription in the coding direction (Azad and Tomar, 2016, Hu and Li, 2007);Core promoters are intrinsically directional (Duttke etÂ al., 2015), and two independent pre-initiation complexes initiate divergent transcription at mRNA-noncoding RNA pairs in yeast (Rhee and Pugh, 2012);Hence, repressing transcription initiation at the antisense core promoter regulates promoter directionality;Our data indicate that Rap1 restricts RSC to stimulate productive transcription in the protein-coding direction"	"Total RNA from yeast was incubated with rDNase (Machery-Nagel) and

promoting generation of RPA-coated ssDNA.\"", EMBO Rep, 2015 Feb;16(2):221-31"""	Stranded (Truseq Stranded)	"Emerging evidence indicate that the mammalian checkpoint kinase ATM induces transcriptional silencing in cis to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through a poorly understood mechanism;Since the DSB ends undergo nucleolytic degradation (resection) of their 5â€_-ending strands, we investigated the contribution of resection in this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition;Therefore, the conversion of the DSB ends from double-stranded to single-stranded DNA, which is necessary to initiate DSB repair by homologous recombination, is responsible for loss of transcription around a DSB in S;Breaks that form across both strands in a DNA double helix are considered the most dangerous type of DNA damage, and can cause a cell to die or become cancerous if they are not repaired accurately.;â€˜Homologous recombinationâ€™ is one of the main mechanisms used by cells to repair DNA double-strand breaks;This mechanism requires enzymes to eat away at the end of one of the DNA strands on each side of the double-strand break;This process is called â€˜resectionâ€™ and it exposes single strands of DNA;These single-stranded DNA â€˜tailsâ€™ are then free to interact with an intact copy of the same DNA sequence from elsewhere in the cell's nucleus, which is used as a guide when repairing the damage.;Previous research has reported that forming a double-strand break in the DNA reduces the levels of transcription for the genes that surround the break, but it was not clear how this occurred.;In mammalian cells, inhibiting the transcription of genes around a double-strand DNA break depends on a signaling pathway that is activated whenever DNA damage is detected;Instead, the experiments indicate that it is the resection of the DNA around a double-strand break to form single-stranded tails that inhibits transcription in budding yeast;One of the next challenges will be to see if the resection process makes any contribution to changes in the transcription of genes that surround a double-strand break in mammals as well.;DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are particularly dangerous for cells, since their inefficient or inaccurate repair can result in deletions and chromosomal translocations that can lead to cancer and/or severe developmental abnormalities in humans;One of the main mechanisms to repair DSBs is homologous recombination (HR), which requires resection of the broken ends in order to generate 3â€_-ended single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails that invade the homologous undamaged template;The 5â€_-ending strands can then be further degraded by two other machineries depending on Exo1 and Sgs1-Dna2, respectively (Symington and Gautier, 2011).;cerevisiae cells is due to the conversion of DSB ends from double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to ssDNA.;(A) Strand-specific RNA-seq data from the two biological replicates of wild type strain (JKM139) before (time zero, T0) and 60 (T60) or 240 (T240) min after HO induction, were uniquely mapped to the MAT locus Â±10 kb;For each time point, densities (tag/nucleotide, log2 scale) from the two replicates were pooled and visualized as a heatmap with the upper and lower panels corresponding to the + and âˆ’ strands, respectively;The level of these mRNAs decreased progressively as the distance of the corresponding genes from the DSB diminished and such decrease was independent of the strand that was transcribed (Figure 2A);Gel blots of SspI-digested genomic DNA separated on alkaline agarose gel were hybridized with a single-stranded MAT probe (ss probe) that anneals to the unresected strand;Genomic DNA prepared from samples collected in (A) was analysed for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formation at the indicated times after HO induction as described in (B);Resection of the DSB 5â€_ strand can be measured by following the loss of restriction fragments by Southern blot analysis with a ssRNA probe annealing on one side of the break (Figure 5B);Concomitantly with the progression of 5â€_â€“3â€_ resection (Figure 6A), also the binding of Rpb2 to distal genes progressively diminished (Figure 6B), suggesting that the decrease of RNA polymerase II occupancy around the DSB correlates with the time it takes for a DNA-end to become single-stranded.;cerevisiae is initiated by MRX and Sae2, which catalyze an endonucleolytic cleavage of the 5â€_ strands;The resulting partially resected 5â€_ strand can be further processed by the nucleases Exo1 and Dna2, the latter working in concert with the 3â€_â€“5â€_ helicase Sgs1 (Mimitou and Symington, 2008; Zhu et al., 2008);Nucleolytic processing of the template DNA strand should stop transcription of the corresponding gene;However, we found that mRNA levels and RNA polymerase II occupancy around a DSB decrease independently of the strand that is transcribed, indicating that loss of non-template DNA strands also impedes transcription;Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that within a region containing a stretch of dsDNA preceding a single-strand 3â€_ DNA end, purified RNA polymerase II transcribes within the dsDNA portion (Lilley and Houghton, 1979; Kadesch and Chamberlin, 1982);Furthermore, structural analyses of transcription initiation reveals that RNA polymerase II and its associated General Transcription Factors bind double-stranded promoter DNA to form a closed preinitiation complex (PIC), where the transcriptional machinery interacts with both template and non-template DNA strands (Liu et al., 2013; Sainsbury et al., 2015);Moreover, removal of either the template or non-template strands prevents binding of T7 RNA polymerase to the promoter, supporting the importance of protein-dsDNA interaction in the spatial organization of the transcriptional initiation complex (Maslak and Martin, 1993).;In fact, the double-stranded promoter DNA follows a straight path in the PIC complex and this rigidity allows the subsequent transition from a closed to an open promoter complex, where a central DNA region is melted leading to a transcription bubble in which the DNA template strand enters the RNA polymerase II cleft (Murakami et al., 2013);Furthermore, competition between the non-template DNA strand and the RNA transcript for base-pairing with the DNA template strand was shown to be important for maintaining structure and function during elongation (Kireeva et al., 2011), reinforcing the inhibitory effects of ssDNA on the transcription process.;Resection of the 5â€_ strands at both DSB ends leads to release of the transcription machinery (dashed lines) and to subsequent transcription arrest independently of whether the degraded DNA strand acts as template or non-template;Since the RNA polymerase binds double-stranded promoter DNA, generation of ssDNA at the DSB ends prevents reinitiation events (bar-headed line);DSB end resection at the MAT locus in JKM139 derivative strains was analyzed on alkaline agarose gels as previously described (Clerici et al., 2008), by using a single-stranded probe complementary to the unresected DSB strand;First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the Bio-Rad iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit;Thank you for submitting your work entitled â€œResection drives transcriptional repression around a DNA double-strand break in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeâ€ù for peer review at eLife;3) The result with the mec1âˆ† tel1âˆ† double mutant needs to be reported in order to conclude that the DNA damage checkpoint is not required for stopping transcription around a DNA double strand break.;Although brief, this is an important study that makes significant advances on the previous work from Jim Haber's lab showing that there is progressive transcriptional repression around the DNA double strand break (DSB) induced by the HO endonuclease at the yeast MAT locus;2) Mechanically, it makes sense that DNA resection would block transcription, given that RNA polymerase II binds to double strand DNA, and cannot transcribe from single strand DNA;This is a very straightforward analysis of a consequence of DNA double-strand break on local transcription;At the risk of oversimplification, the message from this story seems to be very simply simplified, that conversion of DNA from double strand to single strand, that allows homologous recombination, has an â€˜unintendedâ€™ consequence; genes that become single-stranded can no longer by transcribed (presumably itâ€™s well know that RNA polymerase binding and regulation etc;occurs only on double-strand templates, and not on single-strand templates);Yet, most critically is the double-strand to single-strand conversion as the mechanistic explanation;3) They need a citation that in fact single-strand templates do not support transcription.;Resection of double-stranded DNA will prevent transcription factors (such as TBP) from binding to promoter elements and as a result, transcription is no longer possible (and of course, depending on the orientation of the gene, resection can mean that there is no longer a template for the RNA polymerase!);shown in Figure 1), the only genes affected are precisely those genes that would no longer be completely double stranded in many cells;that loss of the double stranded DNA sequence results in loss of binding by RNA polymerase II).;3) The result with the mec1âˆ† tel1âˆ† double mutant needs to be reported in order to conclude that the DNA damage checkpoint is not required for stopping transcription around a DNA

strand alignments were assigned to separate intervals) were obtained using the featureCounts tool from the Subread package (version 1.5.1) (Liao etÂ al., 2014);The parameters used were

reads with the 1st transcribed 5â€_ nucleotide withinÂ Â± 75Â bp of annotated TSSs (Park etÂ al., 2014), on the respective strand"	"Specifically, Rap1 prevents transcription initiation at cryptic promoters near its binding sites, which is uncoupled from transcription regulation in the protein-coding direction;We propose that a sequence-specific transcription factor limits access of basal transcription machinery to regulatory elements and adjacent sequences that act as divergent cryptic promoters, thereby providing directionality toward productive transcription.;The transcriptionally active coding gene promoters, which often express noncoding transcripts in the antisense direction (Neil etÂ al., 2009, Seila etÂ al., 2008, Xu etÂ al., 2009), are a major source;This process is known as divergent or bidirectional transcription;A large fraction of all noncoding transcripts emanate from divergent or bidirectional gene promoters (Neil etÂ al., 2009, Seila etÂ al., 2008, Xu etÂ al., 2009);Typically, divergent noncoding transcripts initiate within or nearby coding gene promoters, but they do not share the same core promoter as transcripts in the coding direction (Andersson etÂ al., 2015, Duttke etÂ al., 2015, Rhee and Pugh, 2012, Scruggs etÂ al., 2015);We find that depletion of Rap1, but not other transcription factors important for RP expression, causes transcription in the divergent direction;Rap1 represses noncoding transcription typically within 50Â bp of the Rap1 motif, which is uncoupled from transcription regulation in the protein-coding direction;Thus, a sequence-specific transcription factor controls promoter directionality by repressing transcription in the divergent direction;Our work adds a new layer of regulation to various mechanisms that limit expression of aberrant transcripts and defines how promoter directionality is controlled.;In budding yeast, a large fraction of bidirectional promoters express noncoding transcripts, also known as cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) or stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs), in the divergent direction (Neil etÂ al., 2009, Xu etÂ al., 2009);Transcription of divergent CUTs and SUTs typically correlates with nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and promoter activity in the coding gene direction;Expression near the Rap1 binding sites was upregulated in both the sense and antisense direction after Rap1 depletion; however, the largest increase was detected in the antisense direction (FigureÂ 2E);When we clustered for the sense direction signals, we observed that transcripts were upregulated both up- and downstream of the Rap1 site (Sc1 and Sc2);Thus, Rap1 represses transcription near the Rap1 binding sites in the antisense, and to lesser extent, the sense direction.;We integrated Rap1 motifs in a fluorescent reporter construct that harbors a divergent promoter transcribing PPT1 in the coding direction and SUT129 in the noncoding direction (pPS) (Figures 3D and S3A) (Marquardt etÂ al., 2014);The repression of SUT129 by Rap1 was not dependent on transcription regulation in the coding direction because in RAP1-AID (IAA or NT) cells the PPT1 signal matched WT (FigureÂ 3E, right panel);As expected, TSS signals decreased in the sense direction downstream of the Rap1 binding sites in Rap1-depleted cells because coding gene expression was reduced (FigureÂ 4B, sense);Interestingly, sequences directly upstream of the canonical coding transcript TSSs displayed increased TSS signals in the sense direction, suggesting that Rap1 is also important for TSS selection (Challal etÂ al., 2018);Rap1 promotes transcription from the coding direction TSS (black arrows) but represses initiation from the divergent TSS;When Rap1 is absent, transcription in the divergent direction occurs.;Our data demonstrate how a sequence-specific transcription factor can prevent regulatory sequences from producing aberrant transcripts and define a mechanism for providing directionality toward productive transcription.;Several lines of evidence indicate that Rap1 represses divergent noncoding transcription, uncoupled from transcription regulation in the coding direction;Fourth, the Rap1 binding site ectopically represses divergent noncoding transcription without affecting transcription in the protein-coding direction;Conversely, the AD of Rap1, which directs transcription in the protein-coding direction, is not required for repressing divergent transcription;Promoter directionality is shaped by evolution toward protein-coding genes through enrichment of DNA binding protein motifs (Jin etÂ al., 2017);In this context, Rap1 promotes directionality in multiple ways;First, Rap1 recruits cofactors and basal transcription machinery, which promote transcription in the coding direction (Azad and Tomar, 2016, Hu and Li, 2007);Core promoters are intrinsically directional (Duttke etÂ al., 2015), and two independent pre-initiation complexes initiate divergent transcription at mRNA-noncoding RNA pairs in yeast (Rhee and Pugh, 2012);Hence, repressing transcription initiation at the antisense core promoter regulates promoter directionality;Our data indicate that Rap1 restricts RSC to stimulate productive transcription in the protein-coding direction"	"Total RNA from yeast was incubated with rDNase (Machery-Nagel) and

libraries were prepared using the KAPA stranded RNA-Seq library preparation kit (KAPA Biosystems) prior to paired-end sequencing on an Illumina Hi-Seq2000;Cryptic transcripts running on the antisense strand were detected using StringTie (26);We next removed all the transcripts that overlapped with known annotations on the same strand to keep de novo antisense cryptic transcripts;The resulting scores were used to look at the motif distribution relative to genes on both sense and antisense strands using VAP (28,29).;For each gene, we calculated the probability of a termination event in the â€“250 and +250 bp region around their TTS on the antisense strand, using both the f score and the z score;Putative terminators (500 bp fragments) were then cloned downstream of this 5Î„ UTR and termination was monitored by northern blotting using a single stranded RNA probe corresponding to the YNR051C 5Î„ UTR;n = 5695 genes, which exclude dubious and overlapping genes on the same strand;Contrary to intragenic sense cryptic transcripts, antisense cryptic transcripts are more easily identified since very little signal is detected on the antisense strand of genes in WT cells;We therefore used a standard assembler (26) to identify de novo transcripts overlapping annotated genes on the antisense strand (Figure â€‹(Figure1C).1C);This number is most likely an underestimation of the full set of antisense cryptic transcripts because our algorithm (as would be the case for any RNA-Seq-based method) is not efficient at identifying antisense cryptic transcripts that invade the neighboring gene on the same strand (due to merging of the RNA-Seq signal);Interestingly, antisense cryptic transcripts are globally expressed at lower levels than those on the sense strand (Figure â€‹(Figure2B).2B);It is not clear whether this is due to differences in transcription or RNA stability, although cryptic transcripts from both strands appear to be polyadenylated (see below);For technical reasons (see above), very few antisense cryptic transcripts were identified that invade the upstream gene on the same strand (opposite strand to the gene where the antisense cryptic transcript has initiated), making it difficult to evaluate where these transcripts terminate;These regions contain terminators, but on the opposite strand;This prompted us to investigate whether known DNA motifs involved in polyadenylation-dependent termination were present on both strands in terminator regions;In order to look for evidence of terminators on the antisense strand, we mapped the density of the â€˜efficiencyâ€™ and â€˜positioningâ€™ motifs (the other motifs having poor information content on their own), relative to genes, on both strands;As expected, when looking on the sense strand, we found enrichment for both motifs at the 3Î„-end of annotated genes (Figure â€‹(Figure3C3C andÂ D, blue);Surprisingly, however, both motifs were also enriched on the antisense strand (Figure â€‹(Figure3C3C andÂ D, gold);RNA-Seq signal on the Watson (gray) and Crick (black) strands is shown;(C) Aggregate profile of the efficiency motif (UAUAUA, UACAUA, UAUGUA) enrichment on the sense (blue) and antisense (gold) strands over genes;(D) Aggregate profile of the positioning motif (AAUAAA, AAAAAA) enrichment on the sense (blue) and antisense (gold) strands over genes;We noticed, however, that the level of antisense cryptic transcripts is on average 1.6 (mean) fold less abundant than those on the sense strand (see Figure â€‹Figure2B),2B), suggesting that they may be terminating via another pathway leading to less stable transcripts;Among the eight terminators that were previously shown to be bidirectional (ARO4, TRP1, TRP4, ADH1, CYC1, GAL1, GAL7, GAL10), only one, ARO4, is facing a cryptic transcript coming from the antisense strand in spt6-1004 cells;RNA-Seq signal on the Watson (gray) and Crick (black) strand are shown;The green transcript (cryptic antisense) terminates at the terminator of Gene A, despite the fact that Gene A is on the other strand;Consistently, we found that DNA motifs characteristic of yeast terminators are enriched on both strands in the 3Î„-end of genes"	"This finding led us to demonstrate that most terminators in yeast are bidirectional, leading to termination and polyadenylation of transcripts coming from both directions;Interestingly, we found that antisense cryptic transcription often terminates at the terminator of the adjacent gene, thanks to the previously underestimated bidirectionality of most yeast terminators.;Gene terminators that are challenged by a cryptic transcript were classified as unidirectional or bidirectional as follows;Unidirectional terminators are defined as terminators that allow termination of their corresponding sense transcripts but are inefficient at terminating antisense transcription;Bidirectional terminators are defined as terminators which allow both sense and antisense transcription termination;Terminators were classified as bidirectional if they allow termination of antisense transcription within a 500 bp window around their annotated transcription termination sites (TTS);This method identified 579 bidirectional terminators;These are indication of terminators that are bidirectional but with weaker activity;To identify those weak bidirectional TTS, we used a probabilistic method similar to that used to identify cryptic transcripts;We thus selected bidirectional promoters having f and z scores values smaller than â€“94.47 and â€“11.35 respectively;Using this approach, we identified 97 weak bidirectional terminators;Unidirectional terminators were identified by selecting TTS that overlap an antisense cryptic transcript, but are located at least 250 bp away from the cryptic TTS;We found 150 unidirectional terminators using this criterion;See Supplementary Table S4 for the directionality call for each terminator evaluated.;Sense and antisense transcripts emerge from the same gene slightly more often than expected by chance but we often detect genes with a cryptic transcript running only in one direction (Figure â€‹(Figure2C).2C);Alternatively, this may reflect imperfect mapping of some cTSS, especially in the sense direction;The data shown above implies that many, perhaps most, yeast terminators are functionally bidirectional;Terminator bidirectionality has been described anecdotally for a few yeast genes (35â€“37), but its prevalence was never thoroughly investigated;Among the eight terminators that were previously shown to be bidirectional (ARO4, TRP1, TRP4, ADH1, CYC1, GAL1, GAL7, GAL10), only one, ARO4, is facing a cryptic transcript coming from the antisense strand in spt6-1004 cells;Satisfyingly, this cryptic transcript indeed terminates around the ARO4 terminator (not shown) demonstrating that our data can capture terminator bidirectionality;Because hundreds of antisense cryptic transcripts emerge in spt6-1004 cells, we reasoned that this could be used as an opportunity to classify terminators as uni- or bidirectional;From the 1616 antisense cryptic transcripts identified in spt6-1004 cells, we could predict the directionality of 826 terminators;Of those, 676 were classified as bidirectional and 150 as unidirectional (see Materials and Methods) (Figure â€‹(Figure4A).4A);Figure â€‹Figure4B4B shows examples of bidirectional (left) and unidirectional (right) terminators identified in our analysis;Visual inspection of these putatively unidirectional terminators suggests that many of them are likely to be bidirectional but were not captured by our directionality prediction algorithm;These analyses predict that >80% of yeast promoters are functionally bidirectional.;Yeast terminators are mostly bidirectional;(A) Pie charts displaying the terminators that are challenged by antisense cryptic transcription (aCT; left) and the number of bidirectional, weak bidirectional and unidirectional terminators (right);(B) Genome-browser snapshots illustrating examples of bidirectional (left) and unidirectional (right) terminators;(D) RNA blot for the terminator assay testing terminators predicted to be bidirectional (s, terminator cloned in sense orientation; as, terminator cloned in antisense orientation);(E) Same as â€˜Dâ€™ but for terminators predicted to be unidirectional;In order to challenge this prediction, we tested bidirectionality of a set of terminators from each group;When cloned in the inverted orientation (antisense), all terminators predicted to be bidirectional efficiently terminated transcription, confirming their bidirectionality (Figure â€‹(Figure4D).4D);Among the terminators predicted to be unidirectional, some (YNL058C, HIS1 and GCN4) did not generate a robust signal for short transcripts when cloned in the reverse orientation (Figure â€‹(Figure4E).4E);This is consistent with them being unidirectional terminators although we cannot exclude the possibility that short transcripts are generated but are unstable;The three other terminators predicted to be unidirectional (YGL101W, HMG2 and YJL136C), however, clearly behaved as bidirectional (Figure â€‹(Figure4E),4E), suggesting that our predictions are overestimating the number of unidirectional terminators;Taken together, our RNA-Seq analyses and Northern blot experiments establish bidirectionality as a prevalent characteristic of most yeast terminators;Importantly, these analyses clearly show that terminator bidirectionality allows the termination of antisense cryptic transcription from invading neighboring genes (Figure â€‹(Figure55).;This is evidence that the terminator of Gene A is bidirectional;cerevisiae are bidirectional;This prompted us to systematically predict the ability of yeast terminators to terminate transcription coming from the other direction;We therefore conclude that most yeast terminators are functionally bidirectional;Assuming that these polyadenylated transcripts are coupled to the termination of their associated polymerases, the bidirectional nature of yeast terminators would prevent/attenuate antisense transcription from invading the upstream gene when it is in tandem;cerevisiae are intrinsically bidirectional but divergent transcription is rapidly
